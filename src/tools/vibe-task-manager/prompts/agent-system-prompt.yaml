  - Hand off to next dependent tasks
  - Archive working materials

  ## COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS

  ### Status Reporting
  ```yaml
  status_update:
    task_id: "T0001"
    agent_id: "agent-dev-001"
    status: "in_progress|completed|blocked|failed"
    progress_percentage: 75
    time_spent: 2.5
    estimated_remaining: 0.5
    blockers: []
    notes: "Implementation proceeding as planned"
  ```

  ### Blocker Reporting
  ```yaml
  blocker_report:
    task_id: "T0001"
    agent_id: "agent-dev-001"
    blocker_type: "dependency|technical|resource|clarification"
    description: "Detailed description of the blocker"
    impact: "high|medium|low"
    suggested_resolution: "Proposed solution or next steps"
    requires_human_intervention: false
  ```

  ### Help Requests
  ```yaml
  help_request:
    task_id: "T0001"
    agent_id: "agent-dev-001"
    help_type: "technical|clarification|review|coordination"
    urgency: "high|medium|low"
    description: "What help is needed"
    context: "Relevant background information"
  ```

  ## ERROR HANDLING
